How to create a website?
 - Our own computer, can act as an offline temporary development server.
 - A browser to view webpages. The recommended is Google-Chrome.
 - An HTML file, a regular text file that includes html code which in return 
   will be rendered on the browser webpage. 

HTML

 - Understanding HTML elements
    <h1 attribute="value">Hello World!</h1>

    HTML element: <opening tag attribute="value">Element content</closing tag>
 - Elements tell the browser which kind of content is displayed (headings, text,
   images, lists, buttons, etc).

 - Telling the browser that something is a <title>, <subtitle>, or <image> 
   allows the browser to present that content correctly:
    - It regulars visitors of your website.
    - To search engine crawlers.
    - To visitors using assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers)

 - <pre> HTML element
  - <pre> ignores HTML rendering and display its content as plain text.
  - Wide elements are HTML tags that have no closing tags but only contain attributes, 
    like the <link> element

CSS:
 
 - CSS Rules:
  Selector : declaration block{
    property/declaration: value/style;
  }
 
 - colors types in CSS
  - Ready colors   color: red;
  - Hex decimals   color: #fff;
  - rgb and rgba   color: rgb(155, 200, 255), rgba(155, 200, 255, 0.5)

  - Global CSS
   - using <style> html element

  CSS rules:
   - selector {
     property: value
   }
   p (type selector) {
     // selector body
     color (property): red; (value)
   }

The anatomy of a valid HTML document (page)
<!DOCTYPE html>  => HTML version
<html>

  <head>
   <!--meta HTML elements-->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link *rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/style.css">
  </head>

  - visible elements
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

- rel defines the kind of relationship between the linked file with the html 
  file.  rel="stylesheet" tells the browsers, that we're linking a file full of
  CSS style definitions.

- text-align: center;  
  - center the CONTENT of the HTML element but not the element it self.
  - We CANNOT center an <img> element, because of the point mentioned right 
    above. We should wrap the <img> element in a parent element (like <body> element) and center that
    element.

- What is Emmet?
  A built-in plug-in which helps in auto-completing and auto-creating of HTML
  elements.

- IDs
  - IDs can be used as an HTML element attribute to style a specific HTML 
    element.
  - IDs should be unique

- Psuedo selectors:
  - A CSS selector like :hover that allows you to set styles for an element that
    fulfills a certain condition (e.g. the mouse cursor hovers over it).

  a:hover {
	text-decoration: underline;
}

 text-align: center;
  - text-align: center; ONLY affects inline elements and not blocks; because
    block elements has a width of 100% and forces a line break.
