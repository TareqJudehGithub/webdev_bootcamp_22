How to create a website?
 - Our own computer, can act as an offline temporary development server.
 - A browser to view webpages. The recommended is Google-Chrome.
 - An HTML file, a regular text file that includes html code which in return 
   will be rendered on the browser webpage. 


HTML

 - Understanding HTML elements
    <h1 attribute="value">Hello World!</h1>

    HTML element: <opening tag attribute="value">Element content</closing tag>
 - Elements tell the browser which kind of content is displayed (headings, text,
   images, lists, buttons, etc).

 - Telling the browser that something is a <title>, <subtitle>, or <image> 
   allows the browser to present that content correctly:
    - It regulars visitors of your website.
    - To search engine crawlers.
    - To visitors using assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers)
