Things to remember when creating a new website:
  - Add different features - step by step.
  - Think about the core information that should be transferred.
  - Less is more - don't over style your website.
  - Add white space to the left and right of your website and don't 
    pack your page with content.
  - Fonts
      - Google Fonts are great choice for our websites.
