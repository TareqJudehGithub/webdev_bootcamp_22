Responsive Design
px VS % VS em VS rem

Units (specifically for font-size)
px
 - Easy to understand
 - Limited user focus & NOT scalable (10px will always remain 10px)

%
 - Relative to parent element size
 - Hard to manage due to cascading nature

em
  - Size relative to font-size (default font-size is 16px)
  - Hard to manage due to cascading nature

rem
 - Size is relative to root element's font size
 - Preferred choice if applicable
