Desktop First vs Mobile first

Desktop First is the traditional approach.
Desktop First targets office-based audience.
Desktop First allows us to create feature-rich websites.


Mobile first
 - More functional approach.
 - Less space and less information.
 - For lifestyle/news focused audience (Instagram, facebook, etc)


Media Queries
 - CSS code for responsive design for different screen sizes.
 - Media Queries code in the CSS file, should always be at the end; due to CSS
   cascading nature.


Max-width (Desktop) ==> min-width (Mobile)

Example:
@media (min-width or max-width: 1200px) {
  p {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
}

- For Desktop we start from max-width.
- For Mobile we start from min-width.

Internal links

 - The target selector.
  - Activates CSS rule if defined ID is selected in URL.    #id:target
