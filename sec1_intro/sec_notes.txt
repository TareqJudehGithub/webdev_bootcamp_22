Caching
 - What is caching?
   Caching is Caching (pronounced “cashing”) is the process of storing data in 
   a cache. A cache is a temporary storage area. ... When you return to a page 
   you've recently looked at, the browser can get those files from the cache folder
   rather than the original server, saving you time and saving the network the 
   burden of additional traffics.

Absolute path VS Relative path

  - Absolute path shows/starts from the file path right from the root folder.
  - Relative path shows/starts from the current working directory.
