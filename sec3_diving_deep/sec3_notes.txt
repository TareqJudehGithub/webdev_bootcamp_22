Inheritance
 - Inheritance means, that the selected container rules apply to descendants.
 

Cascading
 - Multiple rules can be applied to the same element.
  h1 {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

Specificity
 - The more specific CSS rule wins.

  Specificity order (from most specific to the less specific):
   1. Inline style (attribute)
   2. ID
   3. Class
   4. HTML element


CSS Selectors
  - HTML Element      <p>             
  - Group Elements    h1, h2, h3
  - ID                #id             Can be used for only one element.
  - class             .class-name     Can be used for multiple elements.

CSS Combiners

Descendants           li p            All <p> with li as ancestor
Child                 h2 > p          Only <p> which are direct children of h2


Inline vs. block-level elements
 - Block elements use the full width of a webpage.
 - Block elements always starts in a new line.
 - Examples of block elements are div, p, and ol/ul
 
 - Inline elements are quite the opposite, they don't create new lines a they
   use only the space needed for the content of that inline element.
 - Inline elements can be displayed next to each other in the same line, unlike
   block elements they are displayed after one another.
 - Inline are part of block elements, for instance <p> <strong>Hi</strong> </p>
 - Examples of inline elements are anchors, buttons, image, and span elements.
 - * We cannot apply vertical margins to inline elements, only horizontal margins 
   does.

display property: Defines they way our contents are display.
  display: inline
  display: block  The element occupies the ENTIRE space of the webpage.
  display inline-block  combines both inline and block values, where we can apply
  vertical margins & paddings.

Margin Collapse
- Top and bottom (vertical) margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single 
margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

box-shadow: (off-set x-axis) (off-set y-axis) (blur radius) (color);
box-shadow: 5px 2px 5px rgba(100, 50, 125, 0.5);
