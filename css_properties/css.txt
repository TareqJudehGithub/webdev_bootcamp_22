CSS properties Cheat Sheets

  overflow:
    - The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit 
      into an area.
    - The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars 
      when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

    The overflow property has the following values:

    visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the 
    element's box
    hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
    scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the 
    content
    auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

  object-fit: 
    - The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be 
      resized to fit its container.
